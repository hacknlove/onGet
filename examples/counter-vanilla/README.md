# onGet Counter Vanilla Example

This example does not require a build system or a view framework, and exists to show the raw onGet API used with ES5.

To try this example, just download the HTML file and open it in your browser.

(The `package.json` in this folder only exists to allow using this folder as a CodeSandbox embed, and is not required
to run the HTML file.)
