# Custom plugin Example

It is not entirely necessary to create a plugin to get this example done, but it is a good one to show how the REST api calls can be abstracted through a custom plugin, so you ask for `openweathermap://barcelona` and you get the client-side processed response of calling `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?APPID=2bde50bdcc809a6230f17e9ba8e7f951&units=metric&q=barcelona`

With custom plugins you can make complex things easier.
