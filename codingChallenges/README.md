# Coding challenges

Some react/redux coding challenges refactored to react/onget, to show how the code become KISSer

If you have doubts about using onGet, and you been using a react coding-challenge in your hiring processes, you can send it to me, so I can add it here, and you can check out by your self if the onGet solution is better than the ones you have been receiving so far.

## WheatherMaps

It uses a custom plugin to abstract a bit more the REST API calls,

## piano

A virtual piano in which you can play song, save them and play them back.
