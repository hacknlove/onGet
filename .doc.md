# The VAFF design pattern

In one way or another, modern web applications are based on components, and this makes it necessary to use some technique to manage the state and the interactions between them.

**VAFF** stands for *virtual API for Frontend* is a design pattern that aims to solve this problem by organizing this part of the front's logic as a sort of API that runs in the browser.

**onGet** is the virtual URLS based library that allows you to use the *VAFF* desing pattern at its maximum level.

This design facilitates a greater decoupling and dynamicity, makes the design and documentation of the API simpler and more intuitive, allows the use of route patterns as expressjs, and most importantly makes the management of these URLs to be delegated to plugins, both proprietary and custom.

Using a onGet your code will be simpler, more readable, more maintainable, and lovely to work with.
